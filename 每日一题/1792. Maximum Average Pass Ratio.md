## 1792. Maximum Average Pass Ratio

There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array `classes`, where `classes[i] = [passi, totali]`. You know beforehand that in the `ith` class, there are `totali` total students, but only `passi` number of students will pass the exam.

You are also given an integer `extraStudents`. There are another `extraStudents` brilliant students that are **guaranteed** to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the `extraStudents` students to a class in a way that **maximizes** the **average** pass ratio across **all** the classes.

The **pass ratio** of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The **average pass ratio** is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.

Return *the **maximum** possible average pass ratio after assigning the* `extraStudents` *students.* Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], extraStudents = 2
Output: 0.78333
Explanation: You can assign the two extra students to the first class. The average pass ratio will be equal to (3/4 + 3/5 + 2/2) / 3 = 0.78333.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: classes = [[2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10]], extraStudents = 4
Output: 0.53485
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= classes.length <= 105`
- `classes[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= passi <= totali <= 105`
- `1 <= extraStudents <= 105`

### 代码

- 用Heap维护一个按照`x/y -> (x+1)/(y+1)` 增量的大根堆，每次从堆顶(增量最多的班级)取出分子和分母，加完1之后放回Heap。依次取出Heap元素求AVG总和，最终得出平均值即可。

```java
class Solution {
    public double maxAverageRatio(int[][] cls, int ex) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> q = new PriorityQueue<int[]>(new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                double x1 = (double) a[0], y1 = (double) a[1], x2 = (double) b[0], y2 = (double) b[1];
                double increment1 =  (y1 - x1) / (y1 * (y1 + 1));
                double increment2 =  (y2 - x2) / (y2 * (y2 + 1));
                return Double.compare(increment2, increment1);
            }
        });
        for (int[] c : cls) q.offer(c);
        while (ex-- > 0) {
            int[] top = q.poll();
            top[0]++;
            top[1]++;
            q.offer(top);
        }
        double res = 0;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int[] top = q.poll();
            res += (double) top[0] / (double) top[1];
        }
        return res / cls.length;
    }
}
```
