## 883. Projection Area of 3D Shapes

https://leetcode.com/problems/projection-area-of-3d-shapes/

You are given an `n x n` `grid` where we place some `1 x 1 x 1` cubes that are axis-aligned with the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes.

Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of the cell `(i, j)`.

We view the projection of these cubes onto the `xy`, `yz`, and `zx` planes.

A **projection** is like a shadow, that maps our **3-dimensional** figure to a **2-dimensional** plane. We are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return *the total area of all three projections*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 17
Explanation: Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[2]]
Output: 5
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,2]]
Output: 8
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 14
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: grid = [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
Output: 21
```

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int projectionArea(int[][] grid) {
        int a = 0;
        int b = 0, c = 0;
        int n = grid.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int row_max = grid[i][0];
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] != 0) a++;
                if (grid[i][j] >= row_max) row_max = grid[i][j];
            }
            b += row_max;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int col_max = grid[0][j];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (grid[i][j] >= col_max) col_max = grid[i][j];
            }
            c += col_max;
        }
        return a + b + c;
    }
}
