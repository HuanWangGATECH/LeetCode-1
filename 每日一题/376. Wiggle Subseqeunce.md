## 376. Wiggle Subseqeunce

https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of the longest **wiggle sequence***.

A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

- For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a **wiggle sequence** because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` are alternately positive and negative.
- In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.

A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

### 代码

- 思路：先对原数组去重，假设此时数组元素个数大于等于2，首尾元素一定是满足条件序列，设`res = 2`.
- 然后对中间的元素，找到满足`nums[i - 1] > nums[i] < nums[i + 1]` 或者 `nums[i - 1] < nums[i] > nums[i + 1] `这样的局部最小值或最大值.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        nums.erase(unique(nums.begin(), nums.end()), nums.end()); // 去重
        if (nums.size() <= 2) return nums.size();
        int res = 2;
        for (int i = 1; i + 1 < nums.size(); i++) {
            int a = nums[i - 1], b = nums[i], c = nums[i + 1];
            if (b > a && b > c || b < a && b < c) res++; // 局部极值
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
